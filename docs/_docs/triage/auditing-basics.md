Dependency-Track incorporates an enterprise-class auditing workflow engine capable of keeping track of audit history, 
comments and analysis decisions for all findings. 

### Auditing Projects

Project auditing is the process of triaging findings on the components for each project. Audit decisions, comments, 
and audit history performed on a project only affect the findings for said project.

The **VULNERABILITY_ANALYSIS** permission is required to perform project auditing.
